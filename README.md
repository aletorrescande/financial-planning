## Financial Planner Considerations


The financial-planner jupyter notebook requires you to add your API_keys in my_keys.env file for code to work.

Variables today, start_date and end_date need to be modified to the dates you want to obtain the data.

Plots can be found under graphics folder, when you run the code new ones will be generated.
